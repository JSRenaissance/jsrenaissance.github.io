# 3DWebBoilerplate

Your quick set up for developing the 3DWeb. This lightweight dev environment structure and process allows for better web animations as fast as possible. 

It utilizes npm http-server, BabylonJS, ThreeJS, TweenJS, AFrame, fontawesome. And in the not-so-distant past; jQuery, d3, and greensock. We've come a long way!

Now it is primed to utilize and innovate AR.js demos.


## Get set up animating the 3DWeb as fast as possible.


- BabylonJS Development Environment - it is very possible to develop Babylon with bigger IDE's - I don't want to.

- Rapid animation requires everything be as light as possible. This maintains maximum flexibility a primary benefit for reaching animation mastery.

- This module is a template environment and a process. Which are second and third benefits toward maximum speed animations.


## First install npm and then npm install -g http-server

 - this will give you a very light-weight server which can be run over any directory.

 - all downstream .htmls can be instantly pulled into view. yet another benefit.

 - in my environment, I keep hundreds of downstream .htmls ready for instant access at any moments notice.

 - allowing fast animation from a library-like lookup structure.


 ## Run-Server 

 - in command line, in the root directory above your code, run: http-server

 - this will start up a server listening on http://localhost:8080

 - where you can access all of your animations under a URL like:  http://localhost:8080/3DWebBoilerplate/demos/template1/

 

 ## Demos

 - The /demos folder is ideal you can iterate into the hundreds of examples in a lookup-like way.

 - Create a new sub-folder under demos and increment the number every time you wish to create a new version of an animation.

 - It gives you a fantastic safety-net to try audacious things. Just do it. And if you like a previous version, it is easy to roll forward to the next version. 

 - A safety-net for tight-rope-walking, another benefit to speed animation. Highly effective. Hardy-har.


 # Animation-Process

 ## Templates123...

 - First look for /demos/template1, /template2, template3/...

 - These are different versions of templates. Helpful? Yes. No? Lol.

 - When you start a new animation - use the template which best matches the task!

 - Duplicate it and up in the brower instantly.

 - See? Now you are ready to rock!


 ## Environment

 - There are important folders at root level within the demos /3d, /img, /lib, /license, and nuance for each.

 - 1. Whenever you add an asset to the environment -> add the license to the /licenses folder <- important. So you make animations that don't forget licenses.
 
 - 2. Add assets to either /3d, /img, or /lib. Just like css, js, img, remember? Same but different.

 - 3. /lib is the best folder because it contains all of the various libraries that create the animation.

 - Right now the /lib folder relies primarily on BabylonJS, ThreeJS, ARJS.

 - But in the past it was jQuery, d3, and Greensock - we've come a long way baby!

 - And yes, it will change somewhere in the world by the next git push.


 ## Projects

 - Another nice thing about this structure is that it export to projects as fast as possible.

 - Simply duplicate the /demo structure with clean sub-folders. Such as /blankProject. Now you are ready to start new projects. Ta-da!

 - Process: run /demos when you are testing capabilities, then duplicate /blankProject123 for the things that you deliver to production.

 
 ## Scenes

 - Check this out. After you duplicate blankProject123 to bigWigClient123, look inside!

 - Beneath all of your template boilerplate is another empty folder called /scene123

 - Duplicate that folder (which can contain scene boilerplates) to rapidly create scenes. Ding!

 - Even better, every scene comes with it's own index.html, so it can be accessed directly.

 - And every scene.js can be included, into a composite scene structure - like a movie. : )

 - Reuse those scenes for all of the new scenes that you make, and you'll be stretching toward nirvana.

 - That is why...



 *I hope this helps you.* : )
